## Project description

### Project idea

#***Briefly describe the idea and stage of the project.
The aim here is to develop an aerial robot manipulator, made up of a drone and a robotic arm with end effector.

Both the Drone and the manipulator will be autonomously controlled: Drone for moving in the space and stabilized in the desired operation position, and the manipulator, which arm joints are controlled, for manipulating a particular object in the space like picking, dragging, painting, drawing, etc.


### The potential outcomes

#***Describe how you see the project result.
We expect a flying robot (Drone + Manipulator) used for the manipulation in the space, in aerial environment, for work at height.

### Using Clover platform

#***Describe how the Clover platform will be used in your project.
The Clover drone is appropriate for this work as flying engine, and a manipulator will be appropriately selected to be connected to its interface. A simulation will be done prior to the real-life application tests.
